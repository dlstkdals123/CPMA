## Exercise 04.13
Only one of the expressions ```++i``` and ```i++``` is exactly the same as ```(i += 1)```; which is it? Justify your answer.

## Answer
My answer : the value of ```(i += 1)``` is i + 1. So, ++i is the same
Actual answer : The expression ++i is equivalent to (i += 1). The value of both expressions is i after the increment has been performed.

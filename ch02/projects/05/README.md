## Project 02.05
Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for x and then displays the value of the following polynomial:   
   
3x⁵ + 2x⁴ - 5x³ - x² + 7x - 6   
   
Hint: C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need to multiply x by itself repeatedly in order to compute the powers of x. (For example, ```x * x * x``` is ```x``` cubed.)

## Answer
See ```ch02p05.c```

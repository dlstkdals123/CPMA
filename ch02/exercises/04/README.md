## Exercise 02.04
Write a program that declares several ```int``` and ```float``` variables--without initializing them--and then prints their values. Is there any pattern to the values? (Usually there isn't.)

## Answer
see ```ch02ex04.c```.

	<Execution>
    i : -858993460
    j : -858993460
    k : -858993460
    x : -107374176.000000
    y : -107374176.000000

There is no pattern

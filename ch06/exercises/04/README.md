## Exercise 06.04
Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two (assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

(a) ```for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) ...```   
(b) ```for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ...```   
(c) ```for (i = 0; i++ < 10; ) ...```   

## Answer
My answer : (c) is not equivalent to (a), (b)   
Actual answer : (c) is not equivalent to (a) and (b), because i is incremented before the loop body is executed.

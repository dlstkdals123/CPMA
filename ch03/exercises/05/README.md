## Exercise 03.05
Suppose that we call ```scanf``` as follows:
```C
scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);
```
If the user enters
```
12.3 45.6 789
```
what will be the values of ```x```, ```i``` and ```y``` after the call? (Assume that ```x``` and ```y``` are ```float``` variables and ```i``` is an ```int``` variable.)

## Answer
My answer	: x = 12.3, i = 45, y = 0.6
Actual answer	: x = 12.3, i = 45, y = 0.6

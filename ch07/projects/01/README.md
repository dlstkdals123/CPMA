## Project 07.01
The ```square2.c``` program of Section 6.3 will fail (usually by printing strange answers) if ```i * i``` exceeds the maximum ```int``` value. Run the program and determine the smallest value of ```n``` that causes failure. Try changing the type of ```i``` to ```short``` and running the program again. (Don't forget to update the conversion specifications in the call of ```printf```!) Then try ```long```. From these experiments, what can you conclude about the number of bits used to store integer types on your machine?

## Answer
See ```ch07p01.c``` and ```ch07p01sol.c```.
